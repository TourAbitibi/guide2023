In this online technical guide, you will find all the details about the event, as well as details about your stay in Abitibi-Témiscamingue. Update from 2023, July 1st : in view of the major forest fires in Quebec, particularly in Abitibi-Temiscamingue, it was decided to replace stage 5 from Senneterre with a stage closer to the host town of Amos. To accommodate this change, the route of stage 6 was used again, but in the opposite direction. See details in the [stage 5][Stage 5 : Amos - RH - Preissac - Amos] tab.
