On behalf of all the members of the board of directors, the organizing committee, I would like to welcome you to the 53rd Tour de l'Abitibi Glencore. We are very proud of our cycling event, the only one in its category in North America! Its longevity is due to the passion, enthusiasm and unconditional commitment of the Témiscabitibians!

For its 53rd edition, the Tour will welcome young cyclists from all over the world. This year, we will be attending the longest Tour de l'Abitibi Glencore, with a total of 686.2 km of racing. As in previous years, team fans can watch the races live on our website at www.tourabitibi.com.

I would like to acknowledge the indispensable work of our many volunteers and our permanent team, who worked throughout the year to offer you a most memorable event during the week of the Tour in Amos. In addition, I would like to make a special mention to our faithful and generous partners, without whom the event would not take place, not to mention our current partner, Glencore.

On behalf of myself and all those involved in the success of this sporting event, I would like to thank the cyclists and their companions for travelling to Abitibi-Timiskaming. To all of you, I wish you the best of luck, and that the visit to our beautiful region will forever be remembered.

Glencore is thrilled to announce its partnership with the Tour de l’Abitibi for the next three years. This event holds deep historical significance in the region, much like Glencore does in Canada.

Through this partnership, Glencore aims to support the international prominence of the Tour de l'Abitibi. It is a nod to the global role our employees play in providing the metals needed for a successful energy transition.

Glencore is proud of this new partnership, which is built upon values cherished by the company.

The health and safety of our employees are top priorities for Glencore. We believe that maintaining healthy lifestyles through engaging in sports activities contributes to the promotion of these values.

Glencore also promotes diversity and inclusion within its teams. Our partnership with the Tour de l'Abitibi, particularly in supporting the development of a women's category in the coming years, aligns with this commitment.

Lastly, we would like to acknowledge the contributions of volunteers, coaches, officials, organizers, and, of course, the riders, without whom this event would not be possible.

To everyone involved, thank you for your dedication!
